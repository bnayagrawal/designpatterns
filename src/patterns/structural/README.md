Structural Patterns
-------------------
Structural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form
larger structures.

#### Structural **class** pattern
Use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations. For example, consider how multiple inheritance
mixes two or more classes into one. The result is a class that combines the properties of its parent classes.

#### Structural **object** pattern
describes ways to compose objects to realize new functionality. The added flexibility
of object composition comes from the ability to change the composition at run-time, which
is impossible with the static class composition.
