Creational Patterns
-------------------

### purpose
* abstract the process of creating objects
* make a system unaware of how objects are created, composed, and represented

### what they do
* encapsulate knowledge about which concrete classes a system uses (access created objects via interfaces)
* hide how instances are created

### provide flexibility w.r.t.
* types of created objects
* responsibility for creation
* how and when objects are created
